###This post is mainly just a test to see how my blog formatting works, and if my coding is any good. Expect actual content sometime in the future.

##Welcome! This is my second journey through Alola, well, half of it, because it took a while before I realised that this series was totally possible.
I'll be documenting my progress, along with really bad jokes, so I hope it's a great time for everyone.

# MOUNT HOKULANI: UTTER DESTRUCTION

We start off our journey with the following team: A lvl 36 Minior, lvl 37 Lurantis, lvl 37 Lopunny, lvl 37 Araquanid, lvl 37 Decidueye, lvl 36 A-marowak. I've already beaten sophocles (and caught Minior), so it's time to clear out the area before I leave.

<sub><sup>Why yes, I am a responsible trainer, and I give the finest of nicknames.</sup></sub>

On my way down, I discover a man standing on a small rock off the side of the mountain, who appears to be practicing his golf swing. How peculiar.

<sub><sup>Ah yes, the rare Alolan Mountain Golfer.</sup></sub>

As it turns out, he's actually a trainer, and has decided to battle me with three Minior of his own. Of course, with me being the superior trainer, my Minior is utterly destroyed and Lopunny needs to spam Jump Kick as per usual.

<sub><sup>Hey now! It's dangerous to stand on a small ledge at the edge of a cliff, Moron!</sup></sub>

Next up is slightly further down the mountain, where a peculiar trainer challenges me with not one, but *two* Pokemon. Yep, he sure is a collector.

<sub><sup>Two trainers with more than one Pokemon in a single route? Game Freak, fix your game.</sup></sub>

And of course, he loses spectacularly to the might of Blue boi.

<sub><sup>Oh no, an eleven year old took my lunch money!</sup></sub>

Ah, it looks like all the trainers have been defeated. Now it's time for the ultimate challenge, the *other* trainer on this route. Spooky. I can tell he's serious, he says he can use a Z-move!

<sub><sup>I sure will be in a minute, nerd.</sup></sub>


Being the real man he is, the first Pokemon he sends out is a Persian, which of course uses fake out on my poor Minior. And then proceeds to destroy Minior with feint attack. Well, I won't fall for it twice you fiend, take a Jump Kick!

<sub><sup>Yeah, that's right.</sup></sub>

Next up is, oh... Absol. It's still faster than Lopunny. And it seems to have a Z-move, which, I'm sure will do nothing.

<sub><sup>Ha, what puny mortal could stand up to my Lopunny? </sup></sub>

Oh.

<sub><sup>Quick attack MVP?</sup></sub>

With the final trainer defeated, and the TM for Snarl in my bag, I think it's time we said goodbye to Mt. Hokulani once and for all. Although, I am curious as to why Lopunny couldn't use All-out Pummeling in that last battle...

<sub><sup>Oh, that's why. Lurantis pls.</sup></sub>

Well, at least it's over, and I can finally head to Malie Garden, probably to listen to Hau talking about something stupid again.

<sub><sup>Shut up, Hau.</sup></sub>


See you next time, everyone!
