Last time, I'd just finished destroying everything at Mt. Hokulani, and I was ready to go back to Malie Garden. However, upon arriving back in town, I noticed a peculiar section that I hadn't noticed before.

<sub><sup>My goodness, is this game allowing me to actually *explore*?</sup></sub>


Eager to finally not be forced onto a linear path, I dove into this new route, when I was immediately stopped by Rotom-dex. What do you want, you silly thing?

<sub><sup>Uh, thanks, I guess?</sup></sub>


Now on a burning time limit to fight everything in my sight like a hungry, meth-fueled racoon, I set my sights on a young man trying to find his way in the world. A comparable feat to stealing candy from a baby, to be sure, but I was desperate to fill my wallet with the tear-ridden dollar bills that only a defeated child could produce.

<sub><sup>Look at him, all wide eyed and bright smiled.</sup></sub>


I promptly destroyed his only Pokemon with a single Leaf Blade. Finally, Lurantis is actually useful.

<sub><sup>No mercy for the weak.</sup></sub>


Before I could allow my morals to set in, I searched high and low for another trainer to siphon more cash from. To my delight, I found two more. To my dismay, they were prepared, and brought weapons.

<sub><sup>I wasn't expecting this.</sup></sub>


A hard fought battle (over the course of two turns), but Lopunny and Lurantis emerged victorous over Liligant and Whimsicott. However, the fight was far from over, as the shortest of my two opponents was determined to see bloodshed, and was prepared to beat it out of me by force.

<sub><sup>The dark lord appears to have found a vessel with which he intends to slay me. RUN.</sup></sub>



My only option was to escape, for fear of losing more than my innocence at the hand of an angry demon child. My hope was shortlived, however, as I faced my next challenge, a man and his Bewear.

<sub><sup>Beware the Bewear! Haha, no seriously, that's a freaking bear. RUN.</sup></sub>


Exploring the route further yielded no more trainers, much to my disappointment, so I allowed my Roto Lotto bonus that had been given to me to diminish as I searched the route for hidden items, and rare Pokemon. My exploration was rewarded with my first Route 11 encounter, Komala!

<sub><sup>Aww, what a sweet little thing, I just want to cuddle it!</sup></sub>


JESUS CHRIST LURANTIS, NO!

<sub><sup>"The foul beast has been slain, my Lord. None shall come to your harm this day." - Lurantis, probably.</sup></sub>


Oh well, I guess it just wasn't meant to be. Continued exploration did lead me to the end of the Route, however, where it looks like my progress had been halted by another arbitrary roadblock, that apparently wasn't even manned at that current time.

Turning back looked like the only option, so I figured that I should at least catch one Pokemon before I finally headed to Malie Garden. Of course, that was, if Lurantis didn't decide to OHKO the next encounter as mercilessly as it did before. The next encounter luckily had a resistance to bug, meaning that it actually had a chance! Enter, Pancham.

<sub><sup>Ah, Pancham, truly the most Tsundere of Fighting types.</sup></sub>


Of course, no part (except for the previous one) is complete without a quick show of the team. I still hadn't moved the Big Root off of Lopunny, but I guarantee it will happen. Eventually. Maybe. Probably not, to be honest.

<sub><sup>Yep, that sure is six Pokemon.</sup></sub>


And that's all for this week! Now that should be all the filler before I resume with the story. See you later everyone!

<sub><sup>Haha, me too buddy, me too.</sup></sub>

### Author's note: For anyone reading, yes, I am playing on an actual console. I'm using Luma to take screenshots, and I have a no-outline patch installed, making the game look nicer (in my opinion). Expect an upload within a week!
