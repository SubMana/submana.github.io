## PkHex Guide: Gaining access to the program, and simple usage tutorial

Hi! This guide assumes you've graduated elementary school at the very least, and have some form of reading comprehension. The first step in using PkHex is gaining access to what's known as 'Homebrew' on your console. This simply requires putting some files on your SD card, and in no way harms your system in the slightest. A much better guide than what I could possibly write can be found here:

### Installing Homebrew!

https://3ds.guide/ **(note, this requires you to be able to put your SD or micro SD card into your PC, so if you cannot do this then you may be out of luck. If this is the case, this guide cannot help you any further.)**

Select 'Get Started', then select your console model, then choose 'Homebrew Launcher (Soundhax)'.

Make _absolutely_ sure that the otherapp file is named correctly, and is in the root of your SD card along with the soundhax .m4a file, enabling File Extensions may be helpful with this.

### Exporting your save!

Secondly, you'll need a Homebrew App called 'JKSM'. This app is the reason you require Homebrew access in the first place, and will allow you to export and import saves for all your 3DS games. This is great for backing up saves if you want to start a million new games without worries, and most importantly, allows us to transfer your save to a PC to edit with PkHex! The app can be found here: https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSM/releases

Once downloaded, open up the .zip and copy the '3ds' folder to the root of your SD card, opting to merge the folders if prompted. You've successfully installed JKSM!

Now you're going to want to access the Homebrew Launcher (through the sound app if you used Soundhax), and start up JKSM (make sure your cartridge is inserted if you're not using a digital game!) and select the game you'd like to export, then 'Save Data Options', then 'Export Save'. You'll be prompted to make a name for this save, which you can make whatever you like, probably 'PkHex' or something.

Put your console's SD (or micro SD) card into your PC. If you'd rather not do this every single time, using a File Transfer Protocol app will allow you to wirelessly transfer your save to your PC. This will not be explained in this guide, but is simple enough to be found on google.

### Using PkHex!

On your SD card, enter the JKSV folder, then 'Saves', then the game that you exported the save from. In that folder you'll find whatever you named the save, probably 'PkHex'. The file inside that folder named 'main' is what we want, so copy that to your computer or just drag it into the PkHex window and edit your save however you like! **Using the 'Tools' tab allows you to instantly import any Pokemon from Showdown, this is very helpful when testing teams on the Battle Spot!**


### Re-injecting your save!

Simply follow the guide for exporting your save, skipping the installation process, and selecting 'Import Save' instead of 'Export Save' when prompted. Make sure that your edited copy is in the right spot on your SD card (in other words, make sure to copy it back if you put it on your PC!).

### Have fun!

Your newly hacked save is now available for use!


# WARNING

Editing trainer data such as gender, money, and other stats (not including genning Pokemon) can get you banned from online services ONLY if you have set up Game Sync on that save file. To get yourself unbanned again, simply import a backup of your save that you hopefully made before you edited it, or erase the save and make a new one. The ban only exists while using the hacked save, and is not permanent in any way.
