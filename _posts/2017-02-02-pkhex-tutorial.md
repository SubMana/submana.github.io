## PkHex Guide: Gaining access to the program, and simple usage tutorial

Hi! This guide assumes you've graduated elementary school at the very least, and have some form of reading comprehension. The first step in using PkHex is gaining access to what's known as 'Homebrew' on your console. This simply requires putting some files on your SD card, and in no way harms your system in the slightest. A much better guide than what I could possibly write can be found here:

###Installing Homebrew!

https://3ds.guide/homebrew-launcher-(soundhax) **(note, this requires you to be able to put your SD or micro SD card into your PC, so if you cannot do this then you may be out of luck. If this is the case, this guide cannot help you any further.)**

You only need to do this step, selecting the 'Continue to Decrypt9' option is not required (but recommended if you want to experiment more with homebrew and Custom Firmware).

###Exporting your save!

Secondly, you'll need a Homebrew App called 'JKSM'. This app is the reason you require Homebrew access in the first place, and will allow you to export and import saves for all your 3DS games. This is great for backing up saves if you want to start a million new games without worries, and most importantly, allows us to transfer your save to a PC to edit with PkHex! The app can be found here: https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSM/releases

Following the readme.txt in the .zip that you download will be required for installation for this app.

Now you're going to want to access the Homebrew Launcher (through the sound app if you used Soundhax), and start up JKSM (make sure your cartridge is inserted if you're not using a digital game!) and select the game you'd like to export, then 'Save Data Options', then 'Export Save', and you're done!

Put your console's SD (or micro SD) card into your PC. If you'd rather not do this every single time, using a File Transfer Protocol app will allow you to wirelessly transfer your save to your PC. This will not be explained in this guide, but is simple enough to be found on google.

###Using PkHex!

Once you've found your save file on your PC (it will be simply called 'main'), drag that into the PkHex window. You are now free to edit your save however you like! **Using the 'Tools' tab allows you to instantly import any Pokemon from Showdown, this is very helpful when testing teams on the Battle Spot!**

###Re-injecting your save!

Simply follow the guide for exporting your save, skipping the installation process, and selecting 'Import Save' instead of 'Export Save' when prompted. Make sure that your edited copy is in the right spot on your SD card (in other words, make sure to copy it back if you put it on your PC!).

###Have fun!

Your newly hacked save is now available for use!


#WARNING

Editing trainer data such as gender, money, and other stats (not including genning Pokemon) can get you banned from online services ONLY if you have set up Game Sync on that save file. To get yourself unbanned again, simply import a backup of your save that you hopefully made before you edited it, or erase the save and make a new one. The ban only exists while using the hacked save, and is not permanent in any way.
